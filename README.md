## My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This portfolio was made using **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and deployed on **Vercel**.

## Miscellaneous Technologies Used
- **[Framer Motion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion):**  A powerful animation library for React that allows for complex animations and gestures. I used Framer Motion to create smooth scroll-on-animate effects, enhancing the user experience with visually engaging transitions..
- **[getform.io](https://getform.io/):** Getform is a headless form backend which I used to collect form submissions and receive email notifications in the Contact section of the site.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The portfolio is fully responsive for devices of all sizes.
- **Interactive Animations:** Using Framer Motion, the portfolio includes subtle animations, adding a dynamic and engaging element to the user experience.
- **Projects Showcase:** Detailed sections for each project, highlighting the technology stack used, features implemented, and links to live demos and GitHub repositories.
- **Contact Form:** A simple and effective way for anyone to get in touch with me directly through the portfolio.
